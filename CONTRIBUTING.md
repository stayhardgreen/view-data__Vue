# Contributing to uPortal Web Components

## Ask a Question

Reach out on [Slack][] or on the [Mailing List][].

## Submit an Issue

- The issue tracker is for issues. Use [Slack][] and the [Mailing List][] for support
- Search the issue tracker (including closed issues) before opening a new issue
- Ensure you’re using the latest version of components
- Use a clear and descriptive title
- Include as much information as possible: steps to reproduce the issue, error message, version, operating system, etcetera
- The more time you put into an issue, the more we will
- The best issue report is a [failing test][] proving it

## Submitting a Pull Request

- Non-trivial changes are often best discussed in an issue first, to prevent you from doing unnecessary work
- For ambitious tasks, you should try to get your work in front of the community for feedback as soon as possible
- New features should be accompanied with tests and documentation
- Don’t include unrelated changes
- Lint and test before submitting code by running `yarn test`
- Write a convincing description of why we should land your pull request: it’s your job to convince us
